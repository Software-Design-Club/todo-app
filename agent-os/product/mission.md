# Product Mission

## Pitch
TaskCollab is a simple todo list application that helps individuals organize their tasks and optionally share lists with others when collaboration is needed.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **Individual Users**: People who want a straightforward way to track personal tasks and projects
- **Casual Collaborators**: Individuals who occasionally need to share a specific list with a friend, family member, or colleague

### User Personas

**Alex Kim** (28, Software Developer)
- **Role:** Full-stack developer at a tech company
- **Context:** Manages personal projects, learning goals, and occasional side work
- **Pain Points:**
  - Existing todo apps are either too basic (no sharing) or too complex (full project management)
  - Needs simple task tracking but occasionally wants to share a list with a collaborator
  - Doesn't want to pay for enterprise features they'll never use
- **Goals:** Clean, simple task management with optional collaboration when needed

**Jordan Smith** (35, Freelancer)
- **Role:** Freelance writer managing multiple assignments
- **Context:** Primarily works solo but sometimes shares deliverable lists with clients
- **Pain Points:**
  - Most apps require everyone to create accounts just to view a shared list
  - Needs task organization but wants minimal overhead
  - Wants to keep personal and shareable lists in one place
- **Goals:** Organize work tasks, share progress with clients when needed, keep it simple

## The Problem

### Task Management Should Be Simple
Most todo apps either lack basic collaboration features or overwhelm users with enterprise project management complexity. Individuals need something in between - a simple way to organize tasks that can easily extend to basic collaboration when needed, without forcing them into complex team workflows.

**Our Solution:** TaskCollab provides straightforward task management with optional list sharing. Create lists, manage tasks with basic status tracking, and invite collaborators only when you need to. No forced team features, no unnecessary complexity - just tasks and the option to share.

## Differentiators

### Simplicity First, Collaboration Optional
Unlike enterprise tools that assume team-based workflows, TaskCollab is designed for individual use with collaboration as an opt-in feature. You're not forced into team spaces, billing plans, or workflow templates - just create lists and add collaborators when you actually need them.

### Basic Permissions That Make Sense
Clear owner/collaborator roles prevent confusion. List owners control who has access and can manage collaborators. Collaborators can work with tasks but can't accidentally break the list or remove the owner. Simple, predictable, no surprises.

### Email-Based Notifications
Stay informed without constantly checking the app. Receive email invitations when someone shares a list with you, and get notified about changes to tasks you're involved in. No app installation required to stay in the loop - everything works through simple email notifications.
