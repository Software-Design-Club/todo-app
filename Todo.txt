Todos:
- [x] Allow users to update state on Todos table
- [x] Make list read only unless user is signed in
- [x] 404 for missing list ID
- [x] User can add todo
- [ ] User can edit todo
- [ ] User "delete" todo
- [ ] Where to put core business logic?
- [ ] User can change lists visibility. Private lists are only visible to the creator and collaborators.
      Public lists are visible to everyone.

Notes:
  - We called `notFound()` in `getListWithTodos` to handle the case where the list ID is not found.
  - This may lead to a pattern where we always respond to a db returning  null with 404 when we may want to do something else.
  - Another way to have a custom 404 page at the specific route
 - Note for next time: list/page.tsx is a server component, AddTodoForm is a client component(it uses useState).
 - We want to update TodoList when AddTodoForm is submitted. TodoList is a client component that uses useState.
 - We need to update the state of TodoList when AddTodoForm is submitted.
