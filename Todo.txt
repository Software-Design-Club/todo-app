Notes:
  - We called `notFound()` in `getListWithTodos` to handle the case where the list ID is not found.
  - This may lead to a pattern where we always respond to a db returning  null with 404 when we may want to do something else.
  - Another way to have a custom 404 page at the specific route
 - Note for next time: list/page.tsx is a server component, AddTodoForm is a client component(it uses useState).
 - We want to update TodoList when AddTodoForm is submitted. TodoList is a client component that uses useState.
 - We need to update the state of TodoList when AddTodoForm is submitted.

Notes 2/2/2025:
- Onblur is not a good event to use to close the edit mode. It seems to prevent the form from being submitted.


Notes 2/9/2025:
- Client side sorting does not keep persist after updating the data.
- We think this is because Next.js is refreshing the page.


Notes 2/16/2025:
- We decided to split the business by route/feature for now
- We will see if we need to change it later.


Notes 2/23/2025:
- We noticed a trade off between using server actions and client side updates. The server actions did not update the client reliably
- We tried revalidating the path, but it did not work.
- We want to investigate if there is some trick/config to make it work.


Notes 5/11/2025:
- Stop using React Query to creat list on home page.
- Server actions and revalidatePath work fine.

Notes 5/18/2025:
- We added collaboration


Notes 7/13/2025:
- Added opaque types to the project.
- Added role to ListCollaborator table.
- Updated findOrCreateAccount to use UserEmail and UserName opaque types.


Notes 7/20/2025:
- Backfilled ListCollaborator table with roles and ids of list creators.
- Added function to check if user is authorized to edit list using the opaque types.
- Found that session.user.id is not user.id from the db.
- Need to fix the type errors in manage-collaborators.tsx and list.tsx


Notes 7/27/2025:
- Updated the Session type from NextAuth to include our Tagged User type.
- Changed Tagged User type to require id.
- Still need to fix the type errors in manage-collaborators.tsx and list.tsx
