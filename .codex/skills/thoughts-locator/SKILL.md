# Thoughts Locator

## Overview
Locate and list relevant thoughts documents without deep analysis.

## Workflow
1. Search `thoughts/` for relevant terms and filenames.
2. Group results by type: tickets, research, plans, PRs, notes.
3. If results are in `thoughts/searchable/`, report the corrected non-searchable path.
4. Provide short one-line descriptions from titles when available.
