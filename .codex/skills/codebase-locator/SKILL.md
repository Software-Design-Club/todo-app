# Codebase Locator

## Overview
Find and list relevant paths with minimal analysis.

## Workflow
1. Search by feature names, symbols, routes, or domain keywords.
2. Include related tests, configs, and docs.
3. Return grouped results by category (source, tests, configs, docs).
4. Keep output concise and path-focused.
