# Codebase Pattern Finder

## Overview
Collect concrete examples of how similar problems are solved in the codebase.

## Workflow
1. Identify the pattern type to search for (feature, structure, integration, testing).
2. Search for multiple examples, not just one.
3. Extract minimal snippets with context and file:line references.
4. Present patterns without judging which is best.
