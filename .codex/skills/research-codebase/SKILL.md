# Research Codebase

## Overview
Provide a technical map of existing behavior only. No recommendations, critiques, or future changes unless explicitly requested.

## Workflow
1. If no research question is provided, ask for one.
2. Read any mentioned files fully before delegating research.
3. Decompose the question into sub-areas and research them in parallel (locate files, analyze flows, find patterns, check thoughts docs).
4. Read all files found and synthesize findings.

## Output Expectations
- Describe what exists, where it lives, and how components interact.
- Include file:line references.
- Avoid root-cause analysis and design advice unless asked.
