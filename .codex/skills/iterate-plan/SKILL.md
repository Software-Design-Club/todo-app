# Iterate Plan

## Overview
Refine an existing plan without losing quality, structure, or accuracy.

## Workflow
1. If no plan path is given, ask for it. If no feedback is given, ask for the changes.
2. Read the plan fully and understand the requested updates.
3. Research only if the changes require new technical understanding.
4. Confirm your understanding of requested changes before editing.
5. Make surgical updates to the plan and keep structure consistent.
6. Sync and summarize changes.

## Guardrails
- Be skeptical and verify feasibility in code.
- Keep automated vs manual success criteria distinct.
- Do not leave open questions in the plan.
