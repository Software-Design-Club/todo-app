name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following REST principles with proper HTTP methods, status codes, and URL conventions. Use this skill when creating or modifying API routes, route handlers, API endpoint files, controller files that handle HTTP requests and responses, or any server-side files that define RESTful endpoints. Use this when working on API versioning, implementing rate limiting, designing resource-based URLs, handling query parameters for filtering/sorting/pagination, or structuring nested resource endpoints. Use this when writing code in files like routes.js, api.js, controllers/, handlers/, endpoints/, or any file that defines HTTP API routes and responses.

# Backend API

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend API.

## When to use this skill:

- When creating or editing API route definition files (e.g., routes.js, api.ts, router.js)
- When writing or modifying API controller files that handle HTTP requests and responses
- When implementing RESTful endpoints with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- When designing resource-based URL structures (e.g., /users, /products, /orders)
- When implementing API versioning strategies in your endpoints
- When adding query parameters for filtering, sorting, pagination, or search functionality
- When setting up rate limiting headers and response structures
- When returning appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500, etc.)
- When working on nested resource endpoints
- When structuring consistent API response formats
