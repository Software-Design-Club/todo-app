name: Backend Migrations
description: Create and manage database migrations with reversible changes, zero-downtime deployments, and proper version control practices. Use this skill when creating database migration files, schema change scripts, or any files that modify database structure. Use this when writing migration files with up/down methods, implementing rollback strategies, creating or modifying database tables, adding or removing columns, creating indexes, or handling data migrations separately from schema changes. Use this when working on files in migration directories like db/migrate/, migrations/, or database/migrations/, or when modifying schema definition files.
